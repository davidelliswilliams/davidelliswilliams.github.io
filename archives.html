              <p>I was contacted by Mirjam who told me of the story of how the cross came into being:</p>
              <p class="italics">It is about the crash of the Lancaster ED928 on the 23 th of June 1943 in Utrecht, neighbourhood called 'Wittevrouwen'. My mother lived there nearby during that time. When the crash occured, some of my friends got hold of a piece of the glass from the cockpit of the ED928. One of those friends made for every female friend of that group a cross (for a necklace) made of that glass. He did that out of respect of the lost lives of the crew. This is the story she once told me. She passed away 8 years ago. She gave that cross to me as a reminder.</p>
