        <h1>Last Flight</h1>
        <p>On the night of the 22nd and 23rd June 1943, the Lancaster ED928 OF-B set off from Bourn on a mission to Mulheim during which the aircraft came under attack by a fighter over the city of Utrecht in The Netherlands. The plane exploded in mid-air and debris from the Lancaster reined down into a residential neighbourhood, causing major damage to the buildings and more seriously, civilian casualties.</p>
        <p>The only survivors of the crash were <a href="crew.html">Alexander Laing</a> and <a href="crew.html">Edward Bellis</a> who were taken as Prisoners of War. The remainder of the crew were buried in Utrecht (Soestbergen) General Cemetery in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of photos taken below from the actual crash that have been kindly supplied by <a href="acknowledgements.html">Co Maarschalkerweerd</a>. Co has also authored an excellent detailed piece regarding this flight which was published in the <a href="http://www.afterthebattle.com/osCommerce/product_info.php?products_id=157">After The Battle Issue 41</a> magazine.</p>
